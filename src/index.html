        <h2>Musée du Louvre</h2>
        <p>
            The first Louvre castle was built in 1202. The construction of the Louvre spans more than 800 years. Some
            parts have been destroyed and others added over the years. As a result, the palace has different
            architectural styles. However, most of the structures that make the Musée du Louvre today are in the style
            of the French Renaissance. The features of this period included the greater use of the ancient Classical
            orders of columns and pilasters and a wide variety of decorative plaques and sculptural decoration on the
            facades. This parts were created by the architect Pierre Lescot and the sculptor Jean Goujon.
            At first, the Louvre Palace was just a fortress surrounding Paris. In 1527 it became the royal palace for
            french Kings from Charles V to Louis XIV. It only became a Museum in 1793.
            Today, the Louvre is the biggest museum in the world. It contains 554,731 pieces. In the Louvre, you can see
            works from Antiquity to the 19th century.

        <h2>Musée d'Orsay</h2>
        <p>
            The Musée d’Orsay was built from 1898 to 1900. It was designed by the french architect Victor Latour. This
            building belongs to the Beaux-Arts architectural style. This style was taught at the École des Beaux-Arts in
            Paris, particularly from the 1830s to the end of the 19th century. It drew upon the principles of French
            neoclassicism, but also incorporated Gothic and Renaissance elements, and used modern materials, such as
            iron and glass.
            Victor Latour built this edifice using a bold, expansive, metal-structured glass roof that it conceals with
            a richly ornamented stone cladding.
            Originally, the Musée d'Orsay was a train station built for the Universal Exhibition of 1900. It was a train
            station for 39 years. Then, it was used for diverse things such as packages expedition center or film set.
            In 1977, it was decided to make it a Museum. It opened in 1986.
            The museum holds mainly French art dating from 1848 to 1914, it houses the largest collection of
            impressionist and post-impressionist masterpieces in the world.

        <h2>Centre Pompidou</h2>
        <p>
            The Centre Pompidou was built from 1971 to 1977. It was designed by the italian architects Renzo Piano and
            Richard Rogers. This building has become a true emblem of contemporary art. The idea of Renzo Piano and
            Richard Rogers was to to exteriorize the inside of the building. Usually hidden, the entire load-bearing
            structure as well as the piping is discharged outside the building. The building is upside down ! This frees
            up interior space for activities and makes the layout more flexible and modifiable. The pipes on the outside
            have a colour according to what circulates inside: blue for the air conditioning, green for the water
            circuit.
            yellow for electricity, red for humans and white for cooling towers.
            When the building was created, it was not well received. Critics compared it to an "oil refinery". It
            continued to generate controversy throughout the 1970s before becoming the icon and model it is today. The
            innovative, even revolutionary character of the building raises the Centre Pompidou to the rank of one of
            the most symbolic architectures of the end of the 20th century.
            The museum is entirely devoted to modern and contemporary art. It also hosts exhibitions and cultural
            events.

        <h2>Grand Palais</h2>
        <p>
            The Grand Palais was built from 1897 to 1900. It was designed by the french architects Henri Deglane, Albert
            Louvet, Albert-Félix-Théophile Thomas and Charles Girault. This building belongs to the Beaux-Arts
            architectural style. This style was taught at the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris, particularly from the 1830s
            to the end of the 19th century. It drew upon the principles of French neoclassicism, but also incorporated
            Gothic and Renaissance elements, and used modern materials, such as iron and glass.
            Measuring 13,500 m², the surface area of the Nave of the Grand Palais is the largest glassed-roof space in
            Europe.
            The construction of the Grand Palais followed the demolition of the Palais de l'Industrie as part of the
            preparation works for the Universal Exposition of 1900. Its original vocation was to host the major official
            artistic events of the capital.
            Today, it still fulfills the same objective: there is no permanent collection but there are regular
            exhibitions and prestigious shows.
