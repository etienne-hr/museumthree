        <p class="text">
            The first Louvre castle was built in 1202. The construction of the Louvre spans more than 800 years. Some
            parts have been destroyed and others added over the years. As a result, the palace has different
            architectural styles. However, most of the structures that make the Musée du Louvre today are in the style
            of the French Renaissance. The features of this period included the greater use of the ancient Classical
            orders of columns and pilasters and a wide variety of decorative plaques and sculptural decoration on the
            facades.

        <p class="text">
            The Musée d’Orsay was built from 1898 to 1900. It was designed by the french architect Victor Latour. This
            building belongs to the Beaux-Arts architectural style. This style was taught at the École des Beaux-Arts in
            Paris, particularly from the 1830s to the end of the 19th century. It drew upon the principles of French
            neoclassicism, but also incorporated Gothic and Renaissance elements, and used modern materials, such as
            iron and glass.

        <p class="text">
            The Centre Pompidou was built from 1971 to 1977. It was designed by the italian architects Renzo Piano and
            Richard Rogers. This building has become a true emblem of contemporary art. The idea of Renzo Piano and
            Richard Rogers was to to exteriorize the inside of the building. Usually hidden, the entire load-bearing
            structure as well as the piping is discharged outside the building. The building is upside down ! This frees
            up interior space for activities and makes the layout more flexible and modifiable.

            The Grand Palais was built from 1897 to 1900. It was designed by the french architects Henri Deglane, Albert
            Louvet, Albert-Félix-Théophile Thomas and Charles Girault. This building belongs to the Beaux-Arts
            architectural style. This style was taught at the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris, particularly from the 1830s
            to the end of the 19th century.
